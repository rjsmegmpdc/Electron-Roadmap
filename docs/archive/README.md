## Archive Structure

### `/v2-javascript-era/`
**Purpose:** Documents from an earlier JavaScript-based version of the application

**Contents:**
- `PROJECT-ASSESSMENT.md` - Assessment referencing non-existent `src/js/` architecture
  - **Why Archived:** References JavaScript v2 codebase that predates current Electron/TypeScript implementation
  - **Date Archived:** 6 December 2025
  - **Replacement:** See `ARCHITECTURE.md` in root for current architecture

**Note:** These documents are completely obsolete as they reference a codebase structure that doesn't exist in the current Electron application.

## When to Archive Documents

Documents should be archived when:
1. **Superseded:** Newer, more comprehensive documentation exists
2. **Obsolete:** References non-existent code or architecture
3. **Historical:** Valuable for history but not current development
4. **Redundant:** Information consolidated elsewhere

## When to Delete (vs Archive)

Documents should be deleted only when:
1. Completely incorrect with no historical value
2. Duplicates with no unique information
3. Temporary/scratch notes never meant for long-term storage

**Default:** When in doubt, archive rather than delete.

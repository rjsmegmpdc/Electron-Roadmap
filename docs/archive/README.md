## When to Archive Documents

Documents should be archived when:
1. **Superseded:** Newer, more comprehensive documentation exists
2. **Obsolete:** References non-existent code or architecture
3. **Historical:** Valuable for history but not current development
4. **Redundant:** Information consolidated elsewhere

## When to Delete (vs Archive)

Documents should be deleted only when:
1. Completely incorrect with no historical value
2. Duplicates with no unique information
3. Temporary/scratch notes never meant for long-term storage

**Default:** When in doubt, archive rather than delete.
